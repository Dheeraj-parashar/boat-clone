It is clone of boat website made in june 2023 for mobile view only
Few components were changed by original website during cloning
I have made react components of managable size
Kept the styling as same as possible
pictures and videos are copied from original website
ready made slided and swiper components are used
Database is created locally whenever needed
Link to images are taken as it is from original website and thats why if boat decides to remove those links clone website may not work
I have made database for footer part using AI, on click function dynamically creates the list in footer section
All links leads to original website, only the front page is made by me
Some links will not work as it is for front end only
